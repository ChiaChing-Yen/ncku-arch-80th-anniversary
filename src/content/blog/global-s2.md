Based in New Zealand and Hong Kong and working internationally, the studio received the 2020 Rome Prize in Architecture at the British School, the Australian Home of Tomorrow Competition First Prize, and was one of five international finalists for the National Gallery of Victoria’s 2021 Summer Pavillion Commission in Melbourne. Yun had trained with Glenn Murcutt in Sydney, ZAO/standardarchitecture in Beijing, and Foster+Partners in London prior to establishing the studio with partners Manus Leung and Wenting Guo.
